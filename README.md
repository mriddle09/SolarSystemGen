# Solar System Generator
This project randomly generates unique planets of four different time each time it is run, either a habitable world, a gas giant, an uninhabitable world, or a barren world. 

## Technologies 
This is a Java based project using an open source simplex noise library for randomly generated planet appearances.
The front UI was created with JavaFx.

## Functionality 
Each time a user runs the program a variable number of worlds are generated. These worlds are then displayed to the user
next to a star. The name and type of each planet is displayed. The user can also 
click each planet for further details about each planet. 

## To Add 
Improve and expand planet appearances as well as the ability to save and load planets.
